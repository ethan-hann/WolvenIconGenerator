# Welcome to Wolven Icon Generator (WIG) ðŸ¤–
This is a C# application that allows for creating and extracting `.archive` icons for Cyberpunk2077 without using WolvenKit (GUI).

It contains an integration for [Cyber Radio Assistant](https://github.com/ethan-hann/CyberRadio-Assistant) which allows you to send the generated icon to CRA for a radio station. Initially, this was planned to just be a feature for CRA, however it seems like it would be useful as a generic icon generator and extractor for Cyberpunk 2077 so it was created as its own project and an integration was written between CRA and WIG.
